        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Nihari is a classic North Indian curry typically prepared with
            slow cooked red meat such as lamb. In this recipe, we attempt
            this beloved dish without any meat whatsoever. Prepare yourself
            for a delicious (and spicy) experience! 
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Nihari spice pack (avaialble at your local indian (or asian) store</li>
            <li>4 roma tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 can of coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 jalapenos</li>
            <li>1 red onion</li>
            <li>4 medium sized potatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup of uncooked pinto beans</li>
            <li>2 one inch cinnamon sticks</li>
            <li>1 tsp of cumin seeds</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>Pack of frozen garilc naan</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice the vegetables and garlic</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tsp of oil in a cooking pot</li>
            <li>While waiting for oil to heat, throw the pinto beans
                in a pressure cooker along with a cup and half of water.
                Cook at high pressure for 10 minutes. Fill a second pot
                with water and place on the stove; get that bad boy boiling.
            </li>
            <li>Come back to your heated pan and throw in the tsp of
                cumin seeds
            </li>
            <li>Once you can smell the aroma of the seeds, throw in the garlic, onions, and cinnmon. Stir gently and the veggies sizzle</li>
            <li>As the vegetables saute, throw your diced potatoes in the large boiling pot</li>
            <li>Once the veggies are sauted, pour the coconut milk over them. Add in the nihari spice powder and throw in the roma tomoatos.
                Bring this concotion to boil.
            </li>
            <li>Check back in on the potatoes. If you can easily drive a fork through a potato then it's time to
                drain those fools. Safely isolate the soft potatoes and add them to the pot with everything else.
            </li>
            <li>Once this big pot begins to boil turn off the heat and allow the whole thing to simmer down</li>
            <li>As the pot simmers, heat up your garlic naan (either on a pan or in an air fryer) per the packet instructions</li>
            <li>Finally, check in on the beans you've been slow cooking. Drain them of any excess water and add them into the curry pot</li>
            <li>Mix everything up nice and good and leave to marinate for another 10 minutes</li>
            <li>And....you're done! Enjoy this exceptional batch of delicious curry to your hearts content!</li>
